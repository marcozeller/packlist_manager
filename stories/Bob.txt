Bob loves hicking and camping.
One day he decides to organize his equipment he uses for hicking.

First he writes everything down he used for the last trip.
It was a trip to the mountains in winter.
Since he is really interested in the statistics of his equipment,
he also writes down the weight, and price of every item on the list.

As he plans his next trip he figures out,
that he does not need a lot of the stuff from the last trip.
Since this trip is in spring and less altitude.
As a consequence he copies and adapts the old list.

During this trip his really old tent starts leaking and he has to replace it.
Therefore he adapts all the lists he has with the weight and parts of the new tent.

He foresees were this leads:
Whenever he changes one part of his equipment he needs to update all the lists he made.
So he decides to organize his stuff modular.
He figures out that for all trips (longer than one day) he needs about these modules:
*Sleeping
*Eating/Drinking
*Orientation

For some trips he needs to adapt his:
*Clothing

He figures if he composed his top packing list only with these basic modules
plus some trip-specific items he can keep only one list for every module
and adapt that arbitralily without having to change every list he ever made.

Fortunately he finds a little application which allows him to do exactly this...
