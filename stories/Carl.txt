Carl is a roofer with twelve years of experience in the job.
Five years ago he started his own roof-building-business.
That went went quite well and he soon had more opportunities for contracts,
than he could do on his own.
So he did employ two other experienced roofers since then.

Now he wants to go a step further and train some young people to become roofers themself.
He faces the challenge that the apprentice do not know what tools they need
to acomplish a certain tasks.

Carl decides to write down tools and materials needed to acomplish some task.
He uses a modular approach.
When writing everything down he realizes that some of what he wrote down will
unavoidably change over time.
For example he figures that in the future more work with plastic will be done than today.
And allready today the materials used may vary a lot from one construction side
to another construction side.

He searches for a tool, which allow him to easily adapt the lists he made if.
Fortunately he found exactly that...
